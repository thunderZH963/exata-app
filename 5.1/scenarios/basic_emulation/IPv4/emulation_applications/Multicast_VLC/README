PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of PIM-DM in a tree topology network.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers.
The multicast receivers join the group before the source sends data.
Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are the IGMP routers.
The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.

MCBR is used to transfer 25 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.
