       1-------------------------2-----------------------3
       
In this scenario, node 1 and node 3 are configured as an operational hosts.

Nodes are mapped to operational hosts using IPv6 address mapping.

HTTP from one operational host (Node 1) to another operational host (Node 3).
Also http from one opeartional host (Node 1) to any internal node.

RUN:
-----
Run '<EXATA_HOME>/bin/exata HTTP.config'

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
--------------------------
1. HTTP.config - EXata configuration input file.
2. HTTP.expected.stat - EXata statistics collection.
3. HTTP.nodes - EXata configuration file for node position.
4. HTTP.routes-static - Specifies static route table used to route packets.
5. HTTP_dump.bin - Binary file.
