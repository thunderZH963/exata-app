Nodes are mapped to operational hosts using IPv6 mapping.

Telnet from one operational host (Node 1) to another operational host (Node 3).

RUN:
-----
Run '<EXATA_HOME>/bin/exata Telnet.config'

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
--------------------------
1. Telnet.config - EXata configuration input file.
2. Telnet.expected.stat - EXata statistics collection.
3. Telnet.nodes - EXata configuration file for node position.
4. Telnet.routes-static - Specifies static route table used to route packets.
5. Telnet_dump.bin - Binary file.
