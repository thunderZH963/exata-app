PURPOSE:
---------
This scenario is an example to test the EXata functionality when ipv4 and ipv6 
networks are configured in same scenario. Nodes are mapped to operational hosts
using ipv4 and ipv6 address mapping.


SCENARIO:
----------

     1 ---|                                   |---6
          |---3-------------4-------------5---|
     2 ---|                                   |---7
     
In this scenario, node 4 is a dual-ip node. 
Node 1,2 and 3 belongs to ipv4 network.
Node 5, 6 and 7 belongs to ipv6 network.
'Node 1' and 'Node 2' are mapped to operational hosts using ipv4 address mapping.
'Node 6' and 'Node 7' are mapped to operational hosts using ipv6 address mapping.

In Ipv4 network, streaming of udp packets from external node "Node 1" to external
node "Node 2" is performed using VLC Player.

In Ipv6 network, streaming of udp packets from external node "Node 6" to external
node "Node 7" is performed using VLC Player.

RUN:
-----

Run '<EXATA_HOME>/bin/exata dualip_Nat_yes.config'
