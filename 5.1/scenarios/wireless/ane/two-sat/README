PURPOSE:-
--------
To test simulataneous ANE operation



SCENARIO:-
---------
Two subnets are created each with a connection to a different satellite.  An
inter-satellite link is simulated using an abstract link between 
satellites.

SUBNET 1.0                             SUBNET-2.0
   |                                       |
SATELLITE A(11) <------LINK----------> SATELLITE B (12)

Nine flows are defined which carry FTP traffic from one subnet to
the next in a round-robin fashion.  

FTP/GENERIC <N> <N+1> 0 1000 30S 0S

for N=1..9

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet two-sat.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. two-sat.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. two-sat.config - QualNet configuration input file.
4. two-sat.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. README - This file.
