PURPOSE:-
--------
To test ANE centralized scheduling methods.  



SCENARIO:-
---------
Five subnets are created each with a connection to the satellite (node 51)

                               SUBNET 5.0
                                          SUBNET 4.0


                SUBNET 1.0       51(SAT)       SUBNET 3.0



                               SUBNET 2.0

Forty nine flows are defined which carry FTP traffic from one subnet to
the next in a round-robin fashion.  

FTP/GENERIC <N> <N+1> 0 1000 30S 0S

for N=1..49

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet centralized.config'.
