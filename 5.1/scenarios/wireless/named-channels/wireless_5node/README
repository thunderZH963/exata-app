PURPOSE:
---------
To test whether it is ok to specify both PHY-LISTENING-CHANNEL-MASK and PHY-LISTENING-CHANNELS as long as both of them do not apply at the same level of precedence to the same interface.(ie. There should be no ambiguity.If node 1 has the interface address of 190.0.1.0 and the following is present in the config file
[190.0.1.0]	PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNEL-MASK 1111 
[1]		PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNEL-MASK 1111
[1]	 	PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNELS channel0, channel3
Then eventhough both PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNEL-MASK and PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNELS are present for node 1 there is no need to display an error since the best match for node 1 is 
[190.0.1.0]	PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNEL-MASK 1111 
which has higher precedence than node level and at that level only PHY-LISTENABLE-CHANNEL-MASK is defined.
)


SCENARIO:
----------


Only five nodes are in the scenario. Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are in one wireless subnet 
, Node 3, 4 and 5 are in another wireless subnet.


APPLICATIONS:
--------------
CBR 1 5 100 512 1S 1S 25S PRECEDENCE 0


RUN:
-----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wireless_5node.config'
