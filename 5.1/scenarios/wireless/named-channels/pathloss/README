PURPOSE:
---------
To demonstrate the naming of channels using PROPAGATION-CHANNEL-NAME.
It also checks whether the default naming of channels work.
Also it sets the PHY-LISTENABLE/LISTENING-MASKS internally using the
PHY-LISTENABLE/LISTENING-CHANNELS parameter and channel name.

SCENARIO:
----------

1 ---------- 3 ---------- 2

Only three nodes in the scenario. Node 1 and node 3 are in one wireless subnet 
using one channel, Node 3 and Node 2 are in another wireless subnet using another channel.
Node 3  moves away from node 1 and toward node 2. 

The propagation model PATHLOSS-MATRIX is used for both channels.
