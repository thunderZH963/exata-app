PURPOSE:-
--------
STAR-LORA test for 5 nodes in wireless scenario with mobility.



SCENARIO:-
---------

Simulation starts with the node position specified in "default.nodes" file,
then RANDOM-WAYPOINT mobility is applied with all the nodes.


CBR is used to send 10 data packets of 512B from node 1 to node 4.
CBR is used to send 10 data packets of 512B from node 2 to node 5.




RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. README - This file.
