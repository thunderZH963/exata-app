PURPOSE:-
--------
To test operation of mac satellite bentpipe with phy satellite rsv
supporting multiple channels


SCENARIO:-
---------
A single subnet with four nodes is created in the simulation.  


           SATELLITE (1)
            /    |    \
           /     |     \
          /      |      \
       GS (2)  GS (3)  GS (4)

Three application flows are there:

LOOKUP application:

LOOKUP 2 3 0 512 100 1.00S 0S 10S 295S
LOOKUP 3 4 0 512 100 1.00S 0S 10S 295S
LOOKUP 4 2 0 512 100 1.00S 0S 10S 295S

LOOKUP 3 2 0 512 100 1.00S 0S 10S 295S
LOOKUP 4 3 0 512 100 1.00S 0S 10S 295S
LOOKUP 2 4 0 512 100 1.00S 0S 10S 295S



HOW THE SCENARIO WILL WORK:
---------------------------

The uplink channels configured at satellite node 1 are 0, 1 and 2.

Ground stations with node id 2, 3 and 4 are configured with uplink channels 
as 0, 1 and 2 respectively.

Ground stations with node id 2, 3 and 4 are configured with downlink channels
as 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

When the Satellite node will receive data on uplink channel 0(sent by ground station node 2),
it will transmit the data on downlink channels with channel-id 4 and 5.

When the Satellite node will receive data on uplink channel 1(sent by ground station node 3),
it will transmit the data on downlink channels with channel-id 3 and 5.

When the Satellite node will receive data on uplink channel 2(sent by ground station node 4),
it will transmit the data on downlink channels with channel-id 3 and 4.

As ground stations 2 ,3 and 4 are configured with downlink channels 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
Hence, they will receive each other's data via satellite node 1.
