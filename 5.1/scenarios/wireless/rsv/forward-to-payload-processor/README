PURPOSE:-
--------
To test operation of the RSV PHY



SCENARIO:-
---------
A single subnet with three nodes is created in the simulation.  

GROUND STATION (2)   GROUND STATION (3)
        \                /
         \              /
          \            /
           SATELLITE (1)

A single flow between the ground stations is created using the 
LOOKUP application.
A single flow between the ground station (2) and sattelite (1) is created using the 
LOOKUP application.
