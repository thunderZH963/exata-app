PURPOSE:-
--------

StatsDB execution in parallel mode.



HOW TO:-
-------

Currently parallel mode execution of StatsDB is supported with MySQL only.

To execute any StatsDB scenario in parallel mode, following points are a 
MUST to ensure that the configuration parameter "EXPERIMENT-NAME" should
not be set with value "default", as 'default' is a reserved keyword for
MySQL. 

For MySQL configuration, the following parameters are required to be set
in the .config file as given below:


STATS-DB-ENGINE MYSQL
STATS-DB-USERNAME <username>
STATS-DB-PASSWORD <password>
STATS-DB-SERVER  <servername/server IP Address>  # address where the MySQL server is running


Sample configuration:

STATS-DB-ENGINE MYSQL
STATS-DB-USERNAME root
STATS-DB-PASSWORD root123
STATS-DB-SERVER 192.168.2.131  

For more details on StatsDB configuration, please refer StatsDB UsersGuide.
