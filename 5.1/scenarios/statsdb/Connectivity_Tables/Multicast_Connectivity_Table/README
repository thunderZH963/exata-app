PURPOSE:
-------
To show the Multicast connectivity table having root node also have upstream interface.



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 2 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers.  
The multicast receivers join the group before the source sends data.
However, nodes 5 and 7 later temporarily leave the group and rejoin
at a later time.  Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are the IGMP routers.

MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.

Following StatsDB connectivity tables are configure in the config file:

1. Multicast connectivity table is configured to check the connectivity information about multicast protocols.
STATS-DB-MULTICAST-CONNECTIVITY-TABLE YES


RUN:
-------

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Multicast_Connectivity_Table.config'.
