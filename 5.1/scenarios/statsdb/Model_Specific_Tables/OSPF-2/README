PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the OSPF (OSPF External LSA, OSPF Interface State, OSPF Neighbor State, OSPF Network State, OSPF Router LSA, OSPF Summary LSA)StatsDB tables.


SCENARIO:-
---------

Following StatsDB OSPF tables are configure in the config file:

1. The OSPF External LSA table is configured to check the periodic information about the OSPF External Link State Database (LSDB) of an OSPF node.
STATS-DB-OSPF-EXTERNAL-LSA-TABLE YES

2. The OSPF Interface State table is configured to check the periodic information about the OSPF interface state machine of an OSPF node.
STATS-DB-OSPF-INTERFACE-STATE-TABLE YES

3. The OSPF Neighbor State table is configured to check the periodic information about the OSPF neighbor state machine of an OSPF node.
STATS-DB-OSPF-NEIGHBOR-STATE-TABLE YES

4. The OSPF Network State table is configured to check the periodic information about the OSPF Network Link State Database (LSDB) of an OSPF node.
STATS-DB-OSPF-NETWORK-STATE-TABLE YES

5. The OSPF Router LSA table is configured to check the periodic information about the OSPF Router Link State Database (LSDB) of an OSPF node.
STATS-DB-OSPF-ROUTER-LSA-TABLE YES

6. The OSPF Summary LSA table is configured to check the periodic information about the OSPF Summary Link State Database (LSDB) of an OSPF node.
STATS-DB-OSPF-SUMMARY-LSA-TABLE YES



CBR is used to transfer 10 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals starting at 70 minutes into the simulation.
