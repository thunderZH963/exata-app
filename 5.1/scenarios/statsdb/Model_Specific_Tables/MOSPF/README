PURPOSE:
-------
To test the MOSPF Summary tables, provides information in regards to the group LSAs and router LSAs in multicast scenario.



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 5 being the multicast
source and nodes 2, 6, 7 and 9 being the multicast group members.
The multicast members join the group before the source sends data.
However, nodes 7 and 9 leave the group early.
Nodes 4, 8, 12 and 13 are the IGMP routers.
Nodes 4, 8, and 12 are the Inter Area Multicast Forwarder.

MCBR is used to transfer data segments of 512B each at 30 second intervals
until the end of the simulation. Starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.

MOSPF Summary tables is configured in the config file:

STATS-DB-MULTICAST-MOSPF-SUMMARY-TABLE YES


RUN:
-------

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet MOSPF.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------
1. MOSPF.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. MOSPF.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. MOSPF.member - specifies the multicast group.
4. MOSPF.expected.db - QualNet DB collection for MOSPF.
5. MOSPF.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. MOSPF.ospf - specifies the different type of area with range.
7. README - this file.
