     3       4



Node 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 are in wireless subnet.

1. Following applicatios are configured in the scenario:
    i.  CBR application from node 1 to node 2 based on UDP connection
        CBR 1 2 200 512 1S 5S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
        
    ii. Super application from node 1 to node 3 based on TCP connection.
        SUPER-APPLICATION 1 3 DELIVERY-TYPE RELIABLE START-TIME DET 6S DURATION DET 200S REQUEST-NUM DET 50 REQUEST-SIZE DET 512  REQUEST-INTERVAL DET 1MS REQUEST-TOS PRECEDENCE 0 REPLY-PROCESS NO
        
    iii. Super application from node 1 to node 3 based on UDP connection having fragment size is less than the message size.
        SUPER-APPLICATION 1 3 DELIVERY-TYPE UNRELIABLE START-TIME DET 6S DURATION DET 200S REQUEST-NUM DET 50 REQUEST-SIZE DET 200  REQUEST-INTERVAL DET 1MS REQUEST-TOS PRECEDENCE 0 REPLY-PROCESS NO FRAGMENT-SIZE 140

    iii.Multicast application from node 1 to multicast group 225.0.0.0
        MCBR 1 225.0.0.0 200 512 1S 5S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

    
2.Mac protocol is configured as MACDOT11
    MAC-PROTOCOL MACDOT11
    
3. Phy Model is used in the scenario is PHY-ABSTRACT
