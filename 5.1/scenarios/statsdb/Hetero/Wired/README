PURPOSE:-
--------
To test StatsDB in Ipv6-tunnel between a pair of dual-ip enabled nodes
in wired network.


SCENARIO:-
---------


           V6-tunnel(3--4--5)
             =============
1----|      "             "      |----6
     |------3------4------5------|
2----|                           |----7




Node 3  and Node 5 are two Dual-IP nodes with an IPv6-tunnel between them.

Node 1 is sending CBR data to Node 7 and
Node 6 initiates GEN/FTP session with Node 2.

RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet  Wired.config".


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. Wired.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. Wired.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. Wired.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. Wired.expected.db - QualNet DB collection.
5. Wired.tunnel - QualNet Dual-IP tunnel configuration file.
6. README - This file.
