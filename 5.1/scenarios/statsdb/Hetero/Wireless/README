PURPOSE:-
--------
To test StatsDB in Ipv6-tunnel between a  pair of dual-ip enabled nodes
in wireless medium.


SCENARIO:-
---------


            IPv6-Tunnel  (3--4--5)
            =======================

Node 3  and Node 5 are two Dual-IP nodes with an IPv4-tunnel between them.
There are two wireless subnets across the tunnel as shown in above scenario.

Node 1 is sending CBR data to Node 7 and
Node 6 initiates GEN/FTP session with Node 2.



RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet  Wireless.config".
