PURPOSE:-
--------
To test Stats DB description tables for Node, Interface, Queue, Scheduler, Session, Connection, and PHY.



SCENARIO:-
---------

             
       6    1
          
    2          5      
   
     3       4



Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 are in wireless subnet.

1. Following applicatios are configured in the scenario:
    i.  CBR application from node 4 to node 3 based on UDP connection
        CBR 4 3 100 512 1S 5S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
    ii. FTP/GENERIC application from node 1 to node 3 based on TCP connection.
        FTP/GENERIC 1 3 10 512 10 0S 
    iii.Multicast application from node 1 to multicast group 225.0.0.0
        MCBR 1 225.0.0.0 100 512 1S 5S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
    
2.Mac protocol is configured as MACDOT11
    MAC-PROTOCOL MACDOT11
    
3. Phy Model is used in the scenario is PHY-ABSTRACT
    PHY-MODEL PHY-ABSTRACT
    
    
Following StatsDB description tables are configure in the config file:

1. Node description table is configured to check the descriptions of nodes in the scenario.
STATS-DB-NODE-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES

2. Queue description table is configured to check the description of each queue in the simulation.
STATS-DB-QUEUE-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES

3. Scheduler description table is configured to check the description of each scheduler in the simulation.
STATS-DB-SCHEDULER-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES

4. Session description table is configured to check description of each supported application session that exists in the simulation.
STATS-DB-SESSION-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES

5. Connection description table is configured to check the description of transport layer connection(Only for TCP) that exists in the simulation.
STATS-DB-CONNECTION-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES

6. Interface description table is configured to check the descriptions of nodes' interfaces in the scenario.
STATS-DB-INTERFACE-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES

7. PHY description table is configured to check the description of each PHY index in the simulation.

STATS-DB-PHY-DESCRIPTION-TABLE YES
