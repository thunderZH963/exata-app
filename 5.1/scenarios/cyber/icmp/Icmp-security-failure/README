PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the Icmp Security Failure message generation.

SCENARIO:-
--------
Nodes 1 to 6 are connected by wired point to point network as shown in 
the figure. Node 3 (outbound[Node 3 to Node 4] and inbound [Node 4 to 
Node 3]) and Node 4 (outbound[Node 4 to Node 3] and inbound[Node 3 to 
Node 4]) are IPSec enabled. Node 1 is sending CBR packets to node 6  
and Node 6 is sending CBR packets to node 1. Ipsec file is configured with
security policies having DISCARD option.
