	3. Counter-measures against, jamming and denial of
	   service counter-attacks, kinetic strike and application 
	   traffic encryption) the attack.
	4. Use of Metasploit to mimic virus attacks 
	5. Use of Snort to detect intrusions.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENT:
--------------------
1. One computer with three Ethernet interfaces.
2. Four computers with one Ethernet interface each:
    -Application Source (Operational Host 1).
    -Application Destination (Operational Host 2).
    -Cyber Attacker (Operational Host 3).
    -Emulation Machine 
    -VR FORCE Machine 
3. One switch or hub.
4. Three standard Ethernet cables.
5. Two "cross-over" Ethernet cables.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT:
-------------------
1. One copy of EXata/Cyber.
2. One copy of VR Forces.
3. VLC media player (version 1.1.10 or newer) for video streaming 
   (available at http://www.videolan.org/vlc).
4. Microsoft Net meeting, for online text and video chatting.
5. Snort® intrusion detection software 
   (available at http://www.snort.org).
6. Metasploit® Framework 
   (available at http://www.metasploit.com).
7. Internet Explorer, version 6.0.

SCENARIO:-
---------
  
There is total 24 nodes in the scenario. Nodes 7 to 30 are in a
wireless subnet. Nodes 9, 27, 31 are in satellite subnet. 
Routing protocol is configured as OLSR except on node 31. A firewall 
has been configured at node 9. By default the sceanrio runs witout VR-Forces
To run this scenario with VR-Forces, edit the config file and change HLA 
to YES and configure the corresponding parameters.
  
Applications are configured as below:
  
    CBR 7 8 0 512 1S 1S 179M PRECEDENCE 0 
    CBR 11 12 0 512 1D 1S 179M PRECEDENCE 0 
    CBR 20 19 0 512 5H 1S 179M PRECEDENCE 0 
    CBR 21 19 0 512 5H 1S 179M PRECEDENCE 0 
    CBR 29 19 0 512 5H 1S 179M PRECEDENCE 0 
    CBR 30 19 0 512 5H 1S 179M PRECEDENCE 0
  
  
 TEST PROCIDURE:
 --------------
 1. Node 16 is the emulation Application source.Connect node 16 to Operation Host1.
 
 2. Node 9 is the destination node. Connect Node 9 to Operational Host2.
 
 3. Node 21 is the attacker node. Connect Node 21 to Operational Host3.
 
 4. Open the VR Force scenario on the Operational Host 3 if VR Force to be used.
 
 5. Start video streaming at Operation Host with unicast destination address
    of node 9. Video should be correctly received by Operational Host2.
 
 6. To test firewall based defence, Connect Node 19 to Operation Host and 
    start vedio streaming but all packets should be rejected by the 
    firewall and therefore, the video traffic would not reach the VLC 
    application at the Destination host.
    
 7. To test Eavesdropping Attack, Launch VLC media player at the Cyber 
    Attacker host at the receiving mode. At the emulation server, go to the 
    Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) interface,and type the following command, and
    press the button:

		eaves 21 switchheader

    VLC player at the Cyber Attacker host should start receiving video 
    because node 21 is mapped to the Cyber Attacker host in the scenario
    
 8. To launch a virus attack, use the following HITL command:
 
		attack 20 190.0.5.2
		
    This causes node 20 to launch a virus attack.
    
 9. To test Intrusion Detection System, launch a virus attack and on the 
    victim machine use snort to detect the threat.
    
 10. To test counter-measures against attacks, use the following methods:
 	
	1. Jam the communication to prevent eavesdropping.
	2. Launch denial-of-service attack against the attacker that is 
           sending virus packets.
	3. Launch a kinetic strike.
	4. Encrypt the video transmission.
  

11. In this scenario, the Cyber Attacker host uses Metasploit to start a 
    webserver that hosts a website which is infected. The victim machine
    visits this website and gets infected. The result of the infection 
    is to grant the attacker complete access to the victim machine. 
    The attacker is now able to execute any command on the victim machine.
