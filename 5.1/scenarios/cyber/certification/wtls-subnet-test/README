PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of WTLS certification implementation in a scenario 
when the certificate is enabled on the subnet.


SCENARIO:-
---------

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 belong to a wireless subnet. WTLS certificate is enabled on
the subnet as shown in figure.

Application:
------------
FTP/GENERIC application is configured between Node 1 and Node 3. 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wtls-subnet-test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. wtls-subnet-test.app             - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. wtls-subnet-test.config          - QualNet configuration input file.
3. wtls-subnet-test.expected.stat   - QualNet statistics collection.
4. wtls-subnet-test.nodes           - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. default.certificate.[ip address] - WTLS certificate files generated as output for all
                                      the certificate enabled nodes/interfaces
6. README                           - This file.
