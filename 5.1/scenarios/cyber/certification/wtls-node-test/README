PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of WTLS certification implementation in a
scenario when configured at node level.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                                      [5]
                                   
                    [1]
                   
                   
                   
                   
                                              [4]
                  [2] 




                                [3]
     
    
    

Nodes 1 thru 5 are placed in ad-hoc manner.WTLS certificate is enabled on
all the nodes as shown in the figure.

Application:
------------
Two CBR sessions are configured between:
1) Node 1 and Node 3
2) Node 2 and Node 5


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wtls-node-test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. wtls-node-test.app               - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. wtls-node-test.config            - QualNet configuration input file.
3. wtls-node-test.expected.stat     - QualNet statistics collection.
4. wtls-node-test.nodes             - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. default.certificate.[ip address] - WTLS certificate files generated as output for all
                                      the certificate enabled nodes/interfaces
6. README                           - This file.
