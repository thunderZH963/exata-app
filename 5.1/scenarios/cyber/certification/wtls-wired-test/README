Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 4 and 5 through wired point to point links as 
shown in figure. WTLS certificate is enabled on all the nodes.

Application:
------------
FTP/GENERIC application is configured between Node 1 and Node 3. 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wtls-wired-test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. wtls-wired-test.app               - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. wtls-wired-test.config            - QualNet configuration input file.
3. wtls-wired-test.expected.stat     - QualNet statistics collection.
4. wtls-wired-test.nodes             - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. default.certificate.[ip address]  - WTLS certificate files generated as output for all
                                       the certificate enabled nodes/interfaces
6. README                            - This file.
