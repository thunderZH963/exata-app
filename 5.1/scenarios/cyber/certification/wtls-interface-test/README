PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of WTLS certification implementation in a scenario
when certificate is enabled on the interfaces.


SCENARIO:-
---------

Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1, 3 and 4 through wireless point-to-point
links such that Node two is having three interfaces as shown in figure.
WTLS certificate is enabled on all the three interfaces of Node 2.

Application:
------------
One CBR sessions are configured between Node 1 and Node 3 and
One FTP/GENERIC application is configured between Node 2 and Node 4


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wtls-interface-test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. wtls-interface-test.app             - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. wtls-interface-test.config          - QualNet configuration input file.
3. wtls-interface-test.expected.stat   - QualNet statistics collection.
4. wtls-interface-test.nodes           - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. default.certificate.[ip address]    - WTLS certificate files generated as output for all
                                         the certificate enabled nodes/interfaces
6. README                              - This file.
