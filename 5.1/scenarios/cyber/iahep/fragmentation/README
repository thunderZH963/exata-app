PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the behavior of the IAHEP/IP node when an incoming IP packet <= IAHEP-FRAGMENTATION-UNIT  <  IP-FRAGMENTATION-UNIT. After IAHEP processing, the pkt size still remains <= IAHEP-FRAGMENTATION-UNIT .



SCENARIO:-                
---------                
             
[1]--------1.0-----[2]-2.0-[3]-3.0-[4]------4.0------[5]------5.0------[6]-6.0-[7]-7.0-[8]------8.0-------[9]
                       [IAHEP Node]                                        [IAHEP Node]                   
          
IAHEP Nodes - 3, 7                                             
Red Nodes - 2, 8                                             
Black Nodes - 4, 6
BLACK Network (Untrusted) - 4 to 6                                              
RED Network (Trusted) - 1 to 2, 8 to 9
Link Type - Wired
Routing Protocol - OSPF


Application:
------------
CBR application is configured from Node 1 to 9.
CBR application is configured from Node 9 to 1.


Expected Results:
----------------
All application packets should reach the destination nodes.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet iaheptest-1.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. iaheptest-1.app     - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. iaheptest-1.config  - QualNet configuration input file.
3. iaheptest-1.nodes   - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
4. iaheptest-1.amd     - QualNet configuration file for address mapping.
5. README              - This file.
