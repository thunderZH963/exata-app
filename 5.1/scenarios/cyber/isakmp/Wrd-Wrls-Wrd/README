PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionalities of ISAKMP implementation 
in a simple wired wireless Combination Network.


SCENARIO:-
---------
         /------2---- \       Wireless Subnet    /------6-------\
        |              |      --------------    |                |
     1--|              +----  |4          5|----+                +-7
        |              |      |            |    |                |
         \------3----- /      --------------     \------8-------/

There are 8 nodes in the scenario as shown in figure. ISAKMP is enabled on 
Nodes 4 and 5 with individual ISAKMP settings.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 1 is sending CBR packet to Node 7 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Wrd-Wrls-Wrd.config'
