PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionalities of ISAKMP implementation in a simple ISAKMP 
Wireless-Wired-Wireless Combination Network.


SCENARIO:-
---------   Wireless Subnet             Wireless Subnet
        --------------                        ---------------
        |     2       |        Link           |        8      |

        --------------                        ---------------
Two wireless subnets are connected via wired point to point link through 
nodes 5 and 6. ISAKMP is enabled at nodes 2 and 9.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 2 is sending CBR packet to Node 9 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Wrls-Wrd-Wrls-WldCd.config'
