To test wildcard ISAKMP settings (in .isakmp file)
under multiple applications (in .app file).


SCENARIO:-
---------
                Wireless Subnet
                 -------------
                |1     6      |

                |3  4         |
                -------------- 
There are total 6 nodes in the scenario as shown in figure.
ISAKMP is enabled on all nodes and have same ISAKMP setting
(due to wildcard specification)
