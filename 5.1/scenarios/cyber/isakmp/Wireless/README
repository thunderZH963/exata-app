PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionalities of ISAKMP implementation in a simple 
wireless subnet.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                Wireless Subnet                 
                 -------------
                |             |

                |             |
                --------------        

There are 2 nodes in a wireless subnet.ISAKMP is enabled
on both nodes with individual ISAKMP settings.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 1 is sending CBR packet to Node 2 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Wireless.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. Wireless.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. Wireless.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. Wireless.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. Wireless.nodes - QualNet configuration file for node position.
5  node1.isakmp - QualNet isakmp configuration file for node1
6  node2.isakmp - QualNet isakmp configuration file for node2
