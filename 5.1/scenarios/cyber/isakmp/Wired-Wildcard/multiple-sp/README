Node 5  and Node 8  is enabled for ISAKMP node.
One IPSec SA is established between networks 1.0 and 5.0 and
other IPSec SA is established between networks 1.0 and 6.0.
while only one ISAKMP SA is established between node 5 and 8.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 5 sends CBR packets to Node 8
Node 2 sends CBR packets to Node 13


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.isakmp - QualNet isakmp configuration file for node 5.
