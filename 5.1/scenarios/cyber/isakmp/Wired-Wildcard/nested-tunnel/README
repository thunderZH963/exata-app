PURPOSE:-
--------
To test ISAKMP functionalities for nested tunneling using wildcard setting.


SCENARIO:-
---------

------ means link connection

    1                     7
     \                   /
      \                 /
       3----4----5-----6
      /                 \
     /                   \
    2                     8

This scenario checks the basic packet exchanges between the routers/nodes
participating in the ISAKMP in Nested Tunnel network media.

Two IPSEC Tunnels are been established, one between Node 3 & Node 6 & 
Other one between Node 4 & Node 5 at the interfaces specified in their 
respective configuration File. 


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
 Node 3 is sending CBR packet to Node 6 
 Node 4 is sending CBR packet to Node 5


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.isakmp - QualNet ISAKMP configuration file for node 3
5. README - This file.
