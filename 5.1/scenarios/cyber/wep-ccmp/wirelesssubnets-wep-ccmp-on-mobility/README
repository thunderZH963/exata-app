PURPOSE:-
--------
Basic mobility test with both WEP and CCMP configured.


SCENARIO:-
---------   
Wireless Subnet1         Wireless Subnet2 
------------            ------------
|1         3+-----------+5         |
|           |   Link    |        6 |

192.0.0.0                192.0.1.0


Nodes 1,2,3,4 are in wireless subnet 1 and Nodes 5,6,7 are in wireless
subnet 2. Node 3 and Node 5 are connected thrugh wired point to point link.

Subnet 1 is using WEP and subnet 2 is using CCMP (which also supports WEP
when the other party is using WEP). Communication between Subnet 1 and 
Subnet 2 is protected by WEP.

Node 4 is mobile which moves towards WEP subnet to CCMP subnet
and come back to WEP subnet.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 4 is sending CBR packet to Node 5 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wirelesssubnets-wep-ccmp-on-mobility.config'
