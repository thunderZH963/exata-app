PURPOSE:-
--------
Basic test with both WEP and CCMP configured.


SCENARIO:-
---------   
Wireless Subnet 1         Wireless Subnet 2
------------            ------------

        Wireless Subnet 3                   
        ---------------                                      
        |2            |                                      
        |             |                                      
        |             |                                      
        |             |                                      
        ---------------                                      

There are 3 subnets in the scenario. Subnet 2 and 3 are using WEP.
Subnet 1 is using CCMP (which also supports WEP when the other
party is using WEP).Communication between subnet 1 and 3 are protected 
by WEP.


APPLICATIONS:- 
-------------
Node 3 is sending CBR packet to Node 1 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wirelesssubnets-ccmp-wep-on.config'
