PURPOSE:-
--------
To test a wireless scenario with both WEP and CCMP capability.


SCENARIO:-
---------   
Wireless Subnet 1                  Wireless Subnet 2
------------                       ------------

        --------------                   

There are there wireless subnets in the network. Subnet one
(containing node 1,2,3) and subnet two containing node 7,8,9,
and 10)are using WEP. Subnet three (containing node 4,5,6) is 
using CCMP (which also supports WEP when the other party is using WEP).
Only nodes inside the subnet three can communicate with CCMP. 
All other cases must use WEP.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 1 is sending CBR packet to Node 4 
Node 2 is sending CBR packet to Node 10
Node 6 is sending CBR packet to Node 9


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Mixed-wep-ccmp-wep.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. Mixed-wep-ccmp-wep.app - QualNet configuration file 
                            for application input.
2. Mixed-wep-ccmp-wep.config - QualNet configuration input file.
