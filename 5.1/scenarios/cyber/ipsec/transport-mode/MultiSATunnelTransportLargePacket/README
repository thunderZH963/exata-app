Node 1 sends CBR packets to Node 10

Node 5(outbound [Node 5 to Node 8]) and Node 8(inbound [Node 8 to Node 5])
is enabled for IPSec mode

An IPSec tunnel  is established between Node 5 and Node 8.

Two SA entries (both have same tunnel endpoints) are specified
for a single SPD entry (for node 5 and 8) but two SA entries have
different SPI (Security Parameter index) values.
