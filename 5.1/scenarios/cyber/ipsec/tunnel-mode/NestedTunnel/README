PURPOSE:-
--------
To test IPSec functionality testing for nested tunneling.


SCENARIO:-
---------

------ means link connection

    1                     7
     \                   /
      \                 /
       3----4----5-----6
      /                 \
     /                   \
    2                     8


 Node 3 (outbound[node 3 to Node 6]), Node 4 (outbound[node 4 to Node 5]),
 Node 5 (inbound[node 4 to Node 5]) and Node 6 (inbound[node 3 to Node 6])
 are ipsec enabled.

 Two nested IPSec tunnels one between Node 3 and 6
 and other  between Node 4 and 5  are established.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.ipsec - QualNet IPSec configuration file
5. README - This file.
