PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the behavior of bi-directional IPSec tunnels between a pair of IPSec
enabled nodes (using 2 SPD entries for each node) when both AH and ESP protocols
are used.


SCENARIO:-
---------

------ means link connection


    1                        5
     \                      /
      \                    /
       \                  /
        3----------------4
       /                  \
      /                    \
     /                      \
    2                        6


Node 3 (outbound[Node 3 to Node 4] and inbound[Node 4 to Node 3]) and
Node 4 (outbound[Node 4 to Node 3] and inbound[Node 3 to Node 4]) are IPSec enabled.
Node 1 is sending CBR packets to node 6  and
Node 6 is sending CBR packets to node 1.



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.

-------------------------
1. default.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.ipsec - QualNet IPSec configuration file
