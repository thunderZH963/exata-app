PURPOSE:-
--------
To test pair-wise shared secret and certificate variant of secure neighbor in one network.

SCENARIO:-
---------

              [wireless subnet]
                 /     \
               /         \
             /             \
            1               2

       
Node 1 and 2 are in a wireless subnet. 
Node 1 is enabled secure neighbor's certificate variant and node 2 is
enabled secure neighbor's pair wise shared secret variant.

In this scenario node 1 and node 2 should be in each others secure neighbor
table and also node 1 should initiate two way handshaking and node 3 should
initiate 3 way handshaking with node 2.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet snd-handhskaking.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. snd-handhskaking.nodes -  QualNet configuration file for node placement.
2. snd-handhskaking.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. snd-handhskaking.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. README - This file.
