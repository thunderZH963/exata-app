PURPOSE:-
--------
To test overall behavior of secure neighborhood where mobility is
encountered.

SCENARIO:-
---------

------ Indicates nodes are within range.

              6

        Final Topology


Single subnet consisting 6 nodes. Initially node 6 is out of range
of other nodes. Mobility is added to node 6 only and it is moving
towards node 2.

Node 6 transmitting CBR to node 4 from simTime 3M to end of
the simulation.
