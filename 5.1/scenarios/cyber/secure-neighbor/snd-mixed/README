PURPOSE:-
--------
To test secure neighborhood behavior in a mixed network.

SCENARIO:-
---------

        [Wireless Subnet]                                 [Wireless Subnet]
           / | \                                             / | \  
         /   |   \                                         /   |   \
       /     |     \                                     /     |     \
      1      3      2 -------------------------------- 4       5      6
       


Node 1, node 2, node 3 are in a wireless subnet and node 4, node 5 and node 6
are in another wireless subnet. Node 2 and node 4 are connected by a wired 
point to point link. 
All the nodes are secure neighbor enabled. 

In this scenario, Secure neighbor should work properly. node 2 and node 4 should
be in each others secure neighbor table.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet snd-mixed.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. snd-mixed.nodes -  QualNet configuration file for node placement.
2. snd-mixed.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. snd-mixed.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. README - This file.
