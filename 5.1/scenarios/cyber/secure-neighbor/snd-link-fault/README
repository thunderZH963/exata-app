PURPOSE:-
--------
To test proper secure neighbor table updation in case of link fault 
and link re-establishment.

SCENARIO:-
---------

               1----------2-----------3
                          |
                          |
                          |
                          |
                          4


Node 1, node 2, node 3 and node 4 are connected by a wired point to point
link. All the nodes are secure neighbor enabled. Link between node 2 and 
node 4 are down from the start time. After 9 minutes the link is 
reestablished.

In this scenario, node 2 and node 4 should not be each others secure neighbor
table at the start of the simulation But after 9 minutes they should be each 
others secure neighbor table.
