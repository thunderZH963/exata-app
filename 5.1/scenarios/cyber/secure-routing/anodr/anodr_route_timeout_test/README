PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of route time out in ANODR routing protocol when configured in a subnet


SCENARIO:-
---------

                          
                            
             [1]             [2] 
                          
                          
                           
                           
Node1 and 2 are placed in a wireless adhoc network.Node1 sends data packets to Node2 at an interval 
of 7 secs. As the interval between the data packets is more than default ANODR-ACTIVE-ROUTE-TIMEOUT
(5secs),a new RREQ should be sent every time the Node1 needs to send data



Application:
------------
CBR application is configured between Node 1 and Node 2


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet anodr_route_timeout_test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. anodr_route_timeout_test.app               - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. anodr_route_timeout_test.config            - QualNet configuration input file.
3. anodr_route_timeout_test.expected.stat     - QualNet statistics collection.
4. anodr_route_timeout_test.nodes             - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. README                            - This file.
