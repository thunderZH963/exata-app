PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of WTLS certification implementation in a wired scenario.


SCENARIO:-
---------

                          
                   
           [3]  [1]          [2]           [4]               
                   
                          
                           
Node1,2,3 and 4 are in a wireless adhoc network.Node1 needs to send data packets to Node4
through Node2.In the middle of receiving the data, Node4 starts moving away from Node2 and
eventually becomes out of range of Node2, Node3 and Node1. Thus Node2 generates and RERR and
unicasts it to Node1.



Application:
------------
CBR is configured between Node 1 and Node 4. 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet anodr_rerr_test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. anodr_rerr_test.app               - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. anodr_rerr_test.config            - QualNet configuration input file.
3. anodr_rerr_test.expected.stat     - QualNet statistics collection.
4. anodr_rerr_test.nodes             - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. README                            - This file.
