PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of ANODR routing protocol when configured in a subnet and used across multiple interfaces.



SCENARIO:-
---------

                            
                            
             [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]
                             
                           
             
                          
 Node1,Node2,Node3 form one wireless adhoc network. Node3 and Node4 form another wireless adhoc network.
 Thus Node3 has two interfaces.The two subnets have been configured to use different frequencies.
                           


Application:
------------
CBR application is configured between Node 1 and Node 4. 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet anodr_mi_test.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. anodr_mi_test.app               - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. anodr_mi_test.config            - QualNet configuration input file.
3. anodr_mi_test.expected.stat     - QualNet statistics collection.
4. anodr_mi_test.nodes             - QualNet Configuration file for node position input.
5. README                          - This file.
