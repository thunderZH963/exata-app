Nodes 1, 2, 3 and 6 are connected through a wired subnet.
All other nodes are connected through wired link as shown in the Figure.
Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are DNS Hosts.
Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,14 ans 15 are DNS Servers.


              [1]     [7]   [9]   [11]   [14] [15]
               |       |       \  /         \  /
